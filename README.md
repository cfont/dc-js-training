This is my repo for the code I write while going through this training course on [LinkedIn Learning](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/dc-js-for-data-science-essential-training/)

### Original Course Details

> Dimensional charting (DC) allows data visualization to display in dashboard widgets as bar charts, scatterplots, heat maps, and more. DC.js is an open source JavaScript library based on Crossfilter and D3.js. In this course, learn how to build interactive, web-based dashboards. Instructor Emma Saunders covers all 20 built-in classes, the suite of included chart types, and the built-in formatting options available in DC.js. Learn how to use jQuery and bootstrap, apply filters, restyle existing dashboards, create custom charts, pair data using DC and D3, link charts, and more.

I think this will only be HTML and Javascript (JS) files but I will create new branches for different sections and chapters and eventually always merge back to the main branch for final, working examples.
